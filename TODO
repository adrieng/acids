Compiler:
- properly print "forall"s for type variables
- record type instantiations for future monomorphization
- fix static type variables, see example in static.split
- clock_types: ct -> ty
- unify handling of interface environments (LocalModule / Modname)
- currently, (x, y) = (1, x) is not considered "causal" (schedulable),
  is this reasonable?
- re-add exhaustiveness checker for patterns (was in interval_typing)
- check if bounds inference works for user-defined enumerated types
- Clock_types is growing enormous, move stuff to Clock_types_utils

Resolution:
- Only compute causal solutions
- User-supplied word reconstruction choice
- Add missing first one in period in linear system
