Compiler:
- Ct variables
- properly print "forall"s for type variables
- record type instantiations for future monomorphization
- fix static type variables, see example in static.split
- interval typing: be more modular, see example in interval.split
- clock_types: ct -> ty
- locations for specs

Resolution:
- Only compute causal solutions
- User-supplied word reconstruction choice
- Add missing first one in period in linear system
