This is a binary version of Acid Synchrone, an experimental programming language
dedicated to high-performance embedded systems. This directory should hold two
executables, asc.byte and solve.byte. The former is the compiler for the
language and the latter is a simple tool to solve scheduling problems formulated
on ultimately periodic integer words.

To run this programs you need an OCaml runtime and an Integer Linear Programming
solver. For the moment, only GLPK is fully supported.

Some examples of Acid Synchrone source code can be found in the examples/
directory.

Do not hesitate to e-mail me with questions and remarks. The full source code
will be available soon.
