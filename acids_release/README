This is a binary version of Acid Synchrone, an experimental programming language
dedicated to stream processing systems. This directory holds two executables,
asc.byte and solve.byte. The former is the compiler for the language and the
latter is a simple tool to solve scheduling problems formulated as constraints
on ultimately periodic integer words.

To run these programs you need an OCaml runtime (version 4.0 should work) and an
Integer Linear Programming solver. For the moment, only GLPK is fully supported.

Type "make" to build the standard library. The compiler should be run
from the acids_release/ directory, or be passed the path to
pervasives.aso through the -I command-line switch.

Some Acid Synchrone source code can be found in the examples/ directory.

Do not hesitate to e-mail me questions and remarks. The full source code will be
available soon.
