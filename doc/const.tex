\section{Const typing}

The goal of static typing is to enable some form of compile-time evaluation
while avoiding the Heptagon quagmire where we basically have two subtly
different languages that do not mix well. The idea of static typing is to have
two different types to distinguish between expressions that can be evaluated to
a compile-time constant, and those who cannot.

\subsection{Expressions}

It is a very simple type system with the following grammar:
\grammar{
  \grammardef{\tau}{\alpha}{static type variables}
  \grammarcase{\St}{stationary stream}
  \grammarcase{\Dt}{non-stationary stream}
}

The type system involves simple sub-typing because a compile-time constant can
be used anywhere a non-constant expression was expected: $\St \mathrel{<:} \Dt$.

\subsection{Nodes}

The programmer can declare static nodes, that is nodes that will not get clocked
and will be carried around in intermediate files. Non-static nodes are black
boxes and therefore cannot be used to define compile-time constants.

A non-static node may not have static inputs. Conversely, its static outputs are
converted to dynamic since they may not be used to define compile-time constants.

The following program is thus rejected:
\begin{verbatim}
let node f () = false

let node g () = 0 when <(b)> where rec b = f ()
\end{verbatim}
Whereas the following one is accepted:
\begin{verbatim}
let static node f () = false

let node g () = 0 when <(b)> where rec b = f ()
\end{verbatim}
